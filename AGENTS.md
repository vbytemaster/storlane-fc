# AGENTS.md — FCL Engineering Rules

## Role

This repository is evolving into FCL: Foundation Core Libraries for modern C++ products.

The repository must stay neutral. Public APIs must not contain downstream product vocabulary or assumptions.

## Language And Toolchain

- Target language: C++23.
- Public API style: C++ modules first.
- Public module files live under `libraries/<lib>/include/fcl/<lib>/*.cppm`.
- Public module declarations should use explicit `export namespace fcl... { ... }`; broad `export { ... }` blocks are forbidden unless a narrow compiler-proven exception is documented next to the code.
- Use C++17 nested namespace syntax (`namespace fcl::raw { ... }`), not legacy nested braces (`namespace fcl { namespace raw { ... } }`).
- Indentation is 3 spaces per level. Hard tabs are forbidden.
- Public `.hpp` / `.h` files under `include/fcl` are forbidden except macro-only headers. Macro-only headers must not declare public types, functions, templates or old header-wrapper APIs.
- Do not create nested public include directories under `include/fcl/<lib>`.
- Do not use `import std;` until the supported toolchain and CI explicitly prove it is stable.

## Library Shape

- Prefer many small targets over one monolithic target.
- Each major layer must become its own target, for example:
  - `fcl_core`
  - `fcl_reflect`
  - `fcl_raw`
  - `fcl_schema`
  - `fcl_config`
  - `fcl_yaml`
  - `fcl_program_options`
  - `fcl_json`
  - `fcl_crypto`
  - `fcl_runtime`
  - `fcl_log`
  - `fcl_app`
  - `fcl_http`
  - `fcl_websocket`
  - `fcl_quic`
  - `fcl_p2p`
  - `fcl_tui`
- Heavy classes that own sockets, event loops, crypto contexts, terminal state, or other external resources should use pimpl.
- Value types, protocol records, and simple POD-like structs should not use pimpl.

## Reflection And Serialization

- New canonical reflection uses Boost.Describe directly.
- Do not add broad reflection macro aliases over Boost.Describe.
- Legacy reflection macro APIs are forbidden in FCL code.
- Old reflect macro families must not return as public reflection APIs; use Boost.Describe directly.
- Binary serialization compatibility with the old FC raw byte layout is a hard gate.
- Any replacement for raw serialization must prove byte-for-byte compatibility with golden tests.
- Reflection field order must be explicit and stable.
- Macro-only serialization declaration helpers such as `FCL_DECLARE_SERIALIZATION`
  may exist for explicit template instantiation, but they must not become a
  reflection system or define field order. Field order remains Boost.Describe.

## JSON, YAML, And Schema

- JSON and YAML APIs must use namespace-style typed codec functions over described types plus an FCL-owned schema layer.
- Legacy JSON class APIs, parser facade APIs and parser classes are forbidden.
- Backend parser types must not leak through public module interfaces.
- Glaze is the JSON/YAML backend dependency. `glz::*` types and Glaze reflection metadata must not appear in public `.cppm` files.
- Validation belongs in schema rules, not in ad hoc parser code.
- Diagnostics must include clear paths, field names, and expected values.
- Secret-like fields must support redaction in configs, logs, diagnostics, and error context.
- `Boost.Program_options` is a backend dependency of `fcl_program_options` only. App/plugin core must not expose `variables_map`, `options_description`, or other CLI parser types.
- Config merge order is schema defaults, config file, environment/custom adapters, then CLI.

## Errors And Logging

- FCL errors are `std`-based and support structured context through `fcl::error::context_error`.
- Use `FCL_THROW`, `FCL_ASSERT`, deadline checks and capture/log helpers with explicit `fcl::error::ctx(...)` or `fcl::error::secret(...)` fields.
- The old FC exception hierarchy, old declare/throw macros and variant-backed exception serialization are removed and must not reappear.
- Context capture must preserve source location and redact secret fields.
- Logging core should stay small: console/file/JSONL-style sinks and structured fields.
- External logging integrations must be optional adapters, not core dependencies.
- Do not log secrets, passphrases, private keys, token values, or raw key material.

## Crypto

- OpenSSL 3+ is the crypto backend baseline.
- There must be one OpenSSL implementation selected in the build graph.
- Do not add BoringSSL.
- Do not shell out to an external `openssl` binary for key or certificate generation.
- Specialized crypto libraries may remain optional targets when they have clear tests and isolated dependencies.
- K1 compatibility must not be replaced with generic OpenSSL ECDSA behavior.
- `fcl_crypto` stays synchronous and low-level. Do not import `fcl_asio`,
  schedulers, threads or runtime policy into crypto primitives.
- WebAuthn parsing must stay private to `fcl_crypto` and must not reintroduce a
  public or vendored JSON parser dependency.

## Runtime And Networking

- Async APIs for heavy operations should use `boost::asio::awaitable<T>`.
- Synchronous wrappers are allowed, but must not be the only API for heavy operations.
- Boost.Asio and Boost.Beast are valid dependencies for future runtime and network targets.
- Legacy networking code from the old codebase must not define the new network API.
- The network family is a set of independent root libraries: `fcl_http`, `fcl_websocket`, `fcl_quic`, and `fcl_p2p`.
- Do not create `libraries/network`, legacy net-prefixed target, module, or namespace forms.
- Runtime workers must have explicit cancellation, bounded queues where needed, and deterministic shutdown.
- Do not introduce `std::async`, ad hoc polling loops, or unmanaged background threads as core runtime behavior.

## App And Plugins

- The app layer is optional, not a mandatory framework.
- Ports define contracts.
- Plugins orchestrate behavior.
- Adapters connect concrete backends and external systems.
- Events may support diagnostics, but must not become hidden business-flow coupling.
- Lifecycle order and reverse shutdown order must be testable.
- Plugins describe config through `describe_config()` and receive typed views through `configure(...)`; plugin core must not parse CLI argv or own YAML parser state.
- Plugin lifecycle methods that may touch resources use `boost::asio::awaitable<void>`: `configure`, `initialize`, `startup`, and `shutdown`. `request_stop()` remains synchronous and `noexcept`.

## TUI

- Terminal UI primitives must be neutral and reusable.
- Backend terminal library types must not leak from public APIs.
- Rendering and headless tests must enforce redaction.
- UI is not a security boundary.

## Dependencies

- Keep dependencies explicit and target-scoped.
- Optional features must be behind CMake options.
- Avoid dependencies in low-level targets if they are only needed by future FCL targets.
- Donor or reference code must not become a build dependency unless explicitly accepted as a dependency.
- Domain targets must form a real directed acyclic graph. A shared CMake BMI-producer target is forbidden; each domain target owns its public `.cppm` files through `FILE_SET CXX_MODULES`.
- If a domain needs reverse imports to build, split the domain instead of hiding the cycle behind an umbrella target.

## Tests

- Every compatibility layer needs golden tests.
- Required test groups include raw serialization, reflection, YAML/JSON/schema, crypto, runtime, network, app lifecycle, logging, and TUI.
- Failing compatibility tests are blockers.
- Do not delete crypto tests during non-crypto cleanup.
- Static checks should enforce that removed legacy zones do not reappear.

## Documentation

- Every `libraries/<lib>` directory must have a `README.md`.
- Library README files describe only the local library: problem, target, public modules, dependencies, examples, tests and boundaries.
- A library README must be useful to a new user without reading implementation files first: state when to use the library, when not to use it, include working module imports and API-shaped examples, name common mistakes, and call out security/redaction concerns when relevant.
- README examples must use real public module names and symbols from the current tree. Do not document future API as if it already exists.
- Cross-cutting architecture belongs under `docs/`, not inside a single library README.
- Markdown links must be relative to the current repository and must point to existing files.
- Absolute local machine paths are forbidden in docs, examples and generated report markdown.
- Downstream product vocabulary belongs only in donor/provenance notes when explicitly needed; reusable FCL docs must stay product-neutral.

## Current Iteration Guardrails

- Keep the repository name unchanged until repository migration is planned.
- Boost.Describe migration must preserve the raw binary compatibility test baseline.
- Do not move neutral libraries from downstream projects until the FCL target structure exists.
- Do not remove crypto primitives in the first pruning pass.
- `fcl_core` is a low-level foundation only. It must not import `fcl.crypto`, `fcl.raw`, `fcl.variant`, `fcl.json` or `fcl.log`.
- `fcl_core` may own neutral diagnostic helpers such as type names, but must not own Boost.Describe member traversal or variant conversion.
- `fcl_reflect` owns only Boost.Describe metadata helpers. It must not import or link `fcl_variant`.
- `fcl_variant` owns described-type conversion to and from `fcl::variant`; described variant mapping must not live in `fcl_reflect`.
- The umbrella `fcl` target must not collect external dependencies "just in case"; put each dependency on the target that owns the include/link usage.
- Raw serialization belongs only to `libraries/raw`; do not define `namespace fcl::raw` or raw overloads in `core`.
- Filesystem/config/path-layout helpers are not part of the FCL core foundation. Use `std::filesystem` directly or keep app-specific helpers in consuming projects.
- Removed FC-like source APIs must not return as public FCL APIs: `fcl::array`, `fcl::fwd`, `fcl::safe`, `fcl::filesystem`, flat/interprocess containers, mock time and compatibility mutexes.
- Public time values use `std::chrono`. FCL core may provide chrono formatting and old FC wire helpers, but old FC-style time source APIs must not return.
- Deterministic tests must pass explicit chrono values instead of relying on a global mock clock.
- Empty/self-export module files are forbidden. Aggregate modules are allowed only as library-level `export import` lists.
- Public APIs must live under `libraries/<lib>/include/fcl/<lib>/*.cppm`; root include trees and old compatibility include roots are forbidden.
- Real module interfaces must contain their declarations directly; `.cppm` files that only include private/public headers are forbidden.
- Macro-only `.hpp` files under `include/fcl` are allowed only for preprocessor macros, because C++ modules cannot export macros.
- `libraries/<lib>/private/fcl` is forbidden.
- Public modules are owned by their domain targets. Do not introduce a global module bridge, shared BMI pool, umbrella module-owner target or dependency shortcut for module ordering.
- Implementation `.cpp` files live directly in `libraries/<lib>/`; nested `src/` directories are forbidden for FCL-owned libraries.
- Third-party source and submodules live under root `vendor/`; `libraries/` contains only FCL-owned code.
- Public module interfaces must not hide private implementation inside `.cppm`; private implementation belongs in module implementation units or private root-level helpers.
